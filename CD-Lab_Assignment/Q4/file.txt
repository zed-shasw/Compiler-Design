After slapping an assistant coach for the Wisconsin men’s basketball team in the head in the handshake line after his team’s loss on Sunday, Michigan Coach Juwan Howard was suspended for five games — the remainder of the regular season — and fined $40,000, the Big Ten Conference announced on Monday. He will be eligible to return for the conference tournament.
